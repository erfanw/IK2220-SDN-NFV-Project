# IK2220-SDN-NFV-Project
SDN&amp;NFV project of IK2220 course at KTH

The target of the course’s assignment is to involve students in modern networking design and implementation using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) principles.



Description

The goal of the assignment is to give you hands-on experience in practical SDN & NFV  implementations. You should learn how to:
●	Emulate network infrastructure,
●	Generate traffic patterns using well-known tools,
●	Launch and program an SDN controller,
●	Instruct the data plane devices using both SDN and NFV techniques,
●	Capture the state of any device in the network,
●	Capture traffic to inspect the message exchanges,
●	Implement advanced network functions (i.e., firewall, load balancer, NAPT, and IDS).


This assignment will be split into two phases.
●	Phase I (Mininet+SDN+Testing)
●	Phase II (NFV+Testing)
